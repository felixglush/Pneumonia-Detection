# Pneumonia-Detection

This is a project I worked on for the AI for Healthcare Nanodegree by Udacity.
It's an end-to-end implementation of a model that detects pneumonia, complete with EDA, data augmentation, train/test splits, training, inference, and an FDA plan.

See [the starter here.](https://github.com/udacity/AIHCND_C2_Starter)

The data (42 GB) can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data).
